## What am I struggling with so far in the boot camp? What do I feel successful at?
  Yesterday I wrote that I was struggling with understanding the concepts of react, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. The next day, which is today, I attended our early morning review requesting that the instructor explain every line of code on my jsx file. This helped me better understand which lines of code were influencing the other parts. On today's assignment, I felt much more comfortable with writing and explaining my code. I did struggle with coupling all of the keys into a single component, but luckily I had a back up and this is my success for the day!
## What can I do in this unit to get my closer to my career goals?  
  Plan and time manage my project creation before jumping into it. I realized the importance of having multiple solutions in case something doesn't work.
## What am I most proud of so far in this boot camp?
  I'm pretty proud of my perseverance and creativity to try something else if my function doesn't work.
## How am I spending my work time? Can I do anything to improve my productivity?
  Sometimes, I find myself spacing out at the screen for god knows how long. I think I do this because I don't have an actual plan. Maybe I should start utilizing my excalidraw account.
## What did I learn from this workshop that I can use when searching for jobs or communicating with potential employers?
  A vision board can lead the blind, what I mean by this is not the fact that I cannot see, but my minds eye loses track of what to do next once I've been coding for too long. I think a checklist would be very beneficial for me.
## What aspects of the last unit can I add to my resume? What are my strengths from that unit?
